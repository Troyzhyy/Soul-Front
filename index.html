                    help people find genuineconnections, whether withinfor-

                </div>
                <p>
                    People today face two main challenges. Firstly, we live in an
                    "information ocean" where it is challenging to find new in-
                    spired content. Secondly, we passively generate vast amounts
                    of data online every day, with little of it providing real value to
                    us. This is where Soul Network steps in. Although we receive
                    new content by recommendation algorithm, the precision of
                    favorable contents doest not meet the expectation due to the
                    limited interpretation on the isolated databases. By offering an
                    open-source and encrypted user database, Soul Network en-
                    sures that users receive highly targeted content and matches,
                    enhancing efficiency in all scenarios. Both challenges are ad-
                    dressed through this solution.
